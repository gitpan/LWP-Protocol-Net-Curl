NAME
    LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl - the power of libcurl in the palm of your
    hands!

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/env perl;
        use common::sense;

        use LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl;
        use WWW::Mechanize;

        ...

DESCRIPTION
    Drop-in replacement for LWP, WWW::Mechanize and their derivatives to use
    Net::Curl as a backend.

    Advantages:

    *   support ftp/ftps/http/https/sftp/scp/SOCKS protocols out-of-box (if
        your libcurl <http://curl.haxx.se/> is compiled to support them)

    *   lightning-fast HTTP compression
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http_compression>

    *   100% compatible with both LWP and WWW::Mechanize test suites

    *   lower CPU/memory usage: this matters if you "fork()" multiple
        downloader instances

LIBCURL INTERFACE
    You may query which LWP protocols are implemented through Net::Curl by
    accessing @LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl::implements.

    Default curl_easy_setopt() options
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html> can be set during
    initialization:

        use LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl
            encoding => '', # use HTTP compression by default
            referer => 'http://google.com/',
            verbose => 1;   # make libcurl print lots of stuff to STDERR

    Options set this way have the lowest precedence. For instance, if
    WWW::Mechanize sets the *Referer:* by it's own, the value you defined
    above won't be used.

TODO
    *   better implementation for non-HTTP protocols

    *   more tests

    *   test exotic LWP usage cases

    *   non-blocking version
