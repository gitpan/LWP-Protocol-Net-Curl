NAME
    LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl - the power of libcurl in the palm of your
    hands!

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/env perl;
        use common::sense;

        use LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl;
        use WWW::Mechanize;

        ...

DESCRIPTION
    Drop-in replacement for LWP, WWW::Mechanize and their derivatives to use
    Net::Curl as a backend.

    Advantages:

    *   support ftp/ftps/http/https/sftp/scp protocols out-of-box (secure
        layer require libcurl <http://curl.haxx.se/> to be compiled with
        TLS/SSL/libssh2 support)

    *   support SOCKS4/5 proxy out-of-box

    *   connection persistence and DNS cache (independent from
        LWP::ConnCache)

    *   lightning-fast HTTP compression
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http_compression> and redirection

    *   lower CPU usage: this matters if you "fork()" multiple downloader
        instances

    *   at last but not least: 100% compatible with both LWP and
        WWW::Mechanize test suites!

LIBCURL INTERFACE
    You may query which LWP protocols are implemented through Net::Curl by
    accessing @LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl::implements.

    Default curl_easy_setopt() options
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html> can be set during
    initialization:

        use LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl
            encoding    => '',  # use HTTP compression by default
            referer     => 'http://google.com/',
            verbose     => 1;   # make libcurl print lots of stuff to STDERR

    Options set this way have the lowest precedence. For instance, if
    WWW::Mechanize sets the *Referer:* by it's own, the value you defined
    above won't be used.

DEBUGGING
    Quickly enable libcurl *verbose* mode via "PERL5OPT" environment
    variable:

        PERL5OPT=-MLWP::Protocol::Net::Curl=verbose,1 perl your-script.pl

    Bonus: it works even if you don't include the "use
    LWP::Protocol::Net::Curl" line!

TODO
    *   better implementation for non-HTTP protocols

    *   more tests

    *   non-blocking version

BUGS
    *   Complain about *Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0xdeadbeef
        during global destruction.* if "fork()" was used somewhere.

SEE ALSO
    *   LWP::Protocol::GHTTP - used as a reference

    *   LWP::Protocol::AnyEvent::http - another reference

    *   Net::Curl - backend for this module

    *   LWP::Curl - provides LWP::UserAgent-compatible API for libcurl
